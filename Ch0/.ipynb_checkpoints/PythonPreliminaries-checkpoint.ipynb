We work hard (say, for one semester of our lives) learning how to give a computer instructions (using Python) and then, for the rest of our lives, everything else is easier and more convenient because we can instruct a computer to do lots of the heavy lifting for us.  <u>In financial terms, we spend a little time now for a bunch of time saved later, and thus the net present value of learning to program is positive.</u>\n",

    "* dict\n",
    "* DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "and we will discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of each type here.\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Lists are the easiest way to deal with data, but they're also the most limited.  For instance, what does `daily_stock_returns[2]` refer to?  We know that it has value $-0.02$, since that's the third element of the list.  But without any other reference point, the utility of this data is low.  We don't know, for instance, what date corresponds to list index value 2.  We also don't know which stock's returns are represented in this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, lists keep track of a very limited amount of information.  They are simple and convenient, and we'll use them as appropriate.  Lists are a fundamental tool, and we'll never do away with them entirely.  However, for certain applications, better tools exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are quick and convenient.  No matter how advanced you get in programming, you will always make use of lists.  However, lists aren't the best tool for every job.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one limitation of lists is that we have to refer to items by their position in the list.  If we type `daily_stock_returns[0]`, we'd get the stock return for the first item in the list.  But what is `0`?  Besides a relative positioning, it doesn't tell us anything.  In some cases, it would be better if we could access other information, like the date of the stock return.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, a `dictionary` is a tool for storing information in a *key-value* structure.  Have a look at the following dictionary, and we'll use it to clarify what is meant by \"key-value.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "finance_dict = {'debt': 'something that is owed or that one is bound to pay to or perform for another',\n",
    "                'equity': 'the monetary value of a property or business beyond any amounts owed on it in mortgages, claims, liens, etc.'\n",
    "                'mortgage': 'a conveyance of an interest in property as security for the repayment of money borrowed'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These words (definitions taken from dictionary.com), make up a small dictionary variable which we've named `finance_dict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each word in the dictionary (`debt`, `equity`, `mortgage`) constitutes a *key*.  We \"look up\" keys in dictionaries to find their *values*.  Thus, the key is a word and the value is the definition.  The command\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "finance_dict['debt']\n",
    "```\n",
    "would return the definition for debt.\n",

    "To add multiple items to a list, the syntax changes!  The `.append()` function takes whatever you put inside the parentheses and adds that input, as is, to the list.  We'll see later that lists are flexible and that makes them quite convenient to use.  However, in this case, the flexibility of a list is tricky.  Lists can store elements of different types, so if we used `.append( [.02, -.01] )` then Python would as a list element to the pre-existing list of numbers.  The following example clarifies."

    "The question becomes: how do we store this information in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate at a CAPM equation (which is covered in the next chapter), we will need to be able to reference $r_{i,t}$, $r_{m,t}$, and $r_{f,t}$ individually, and tell Python what to do with each of these series of returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use lists to keep track of everything then we will have the following:\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "r_i = [0.03, 0.01, -0.02, 0.01, -0.01]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bad practice for at least a couple of reasons.  First, one has to be extremely careful that the data line up properly so that `r_i[k]`, `r_m[k]`, and `r_f[k]` correspond to returns on the same date for every `k`.  Suppose that there is some missing data for some firm $j$ such that `r_j = [0.05, 0.02, 0.03, -0.04]`.  Without any additional information, it is impossible to track down which data point for firm $j$ is missing.  Second, it's difficult to reference returns at a particular date.  Suppose that you want to know the market return on `7/11/19`.  You would first have to determine that `t[k] = '7/11/19'` when `k = 3` and then go look up `r_m[3]` to get the market return.  Note that neither of these considerations imply that it is impossible to use lists to hold all the requisite data, it's just inconvenient for the programmer.  Remember, Python is supposed to make your life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose instead that we use a dictionary based approach to hold all of the data.  One way to do this is to construct a *nested dictionary*.  Nested dictionaries look like:\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "nested_dict = {'finance':\n",
    "                {'verb':'to supply with money or capital',\n",
    "                 'noun':'the management of revenues'},\n",
    "               'rate':\n",
    "                {'verb':'to estimate the value or worth of',\n",
    "                 'noun':'the amount of a charge or payment with reference to some basis of calculation'}\n",
    "              }\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here there is a dictionary with keys `'finance'` and `'rate'`.  The key `'finance'` has a value which is itself a dictionary: one key named `'verb'` which has value equal to the definition of \"finance\" used as a verb and another key named `'noun'` which has value equal to the definition of \"finance\" used as a noun.  Likewise the key `'rate'` has a value which is itself a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one enters `nested_dict['finance']`, Python will return the dictionary `{'verb':'to supply with money or capital', 'noun':'the management of revenues'}`.  Thus, to look up what the noun usage of \"finance\" is, one simply types `nested_dict['finance']['noun']`, which tells Python to look up the `noun` value to the dictionary value given by the key `'finance'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the conext of the current problem, a nested dictionary might look like:\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "daily_returns = {'r_i': {'7/8/19':0.03, '7/9/19':0.01, '7/10/19':-0.02, '7/11/19':0.01, '7/12/19':-0.01},\n",
    "                 'r_m': {'7/8/19':0.02, '7/9/19':0.01, '7/10/19':-0.03, '7/11/19':0.02, '7/12/19':-0.03},\n",
    "                 'r_f': {'7/8/19':0.01, '7/9/19':0.01, '7/10/19':0.01, '7/11/19':0.01, '7/12/19':0.01}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The dictionary approach adds a convenience to the problem.  Now, if one wants to look up the market return on `7/11/19` one simply has to type `daily_returns['r_m']['7/11/19']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this approach still isn't perfect.  Remember, CAPM tells us that the excess return $r_{i,t}-r_{f,t}$ is defined by a linear function of the market risk premium $r_{m,t}-r_{f,t}$.  Therefore, what we want to do is to be able to tell Python to calculate the excess return and the market risk premium.  This is doable with a nested dictionary format, but it's a little complicated.  One would have to do something like the following (feel free to skip this code):\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "daily_returns['r_excess'] = {}\n",
    "daily_returns['r_riskpremium'] = {}\n",
    "for t in daily_returns['r_f'].values():\n",
    "    daily_returns['r_excess'].update(t:daily_returns['r_i'][t]-daily_returns['r_f'][t])\n",
    "    daily_returns['r_riskpremium'].update(t:daily_returns['r_m'][t]-daily_returns['r_f'][t])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is five long lines of code.  That means lots of typing and plenty of room for typos.  Nested dictionaries are *not* the recommended way to hold and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what *is* the recommended way to hold data in Python?  We need to use pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is the standard module for working with datasets in Python, written by Wes McKinney while at AQR Capital Management.  A **module** is a collection of user-defined functions, written by one or more people, and made available for use by everyone.  The `wacc()` function from earlier in this chapter is an example of a user-defined function.  When a set of userful and related functions are created, the author(s) of these functions sometimes choose to share this set of functions with the world to make Python an even more convenient language for everyone else.\n",

    "\n",
    "To reference the functions inside of the `pandas` module, we use `pandas.<function_name>()`.  For example, `pandas` has a function called `read_csv()`, so we would use this function by typing `pandas.read_csv()`.\n",

    "The stock return data that we will use is included with this handout, so we will read the data from CoCalc.  This highlights two important features of the `read_csv()` function.  First, it can pull files from a website directly (as long as the file is formatted as a csv file).  Second, it can read compressed files (note that the file name used here ends with `.gz`, a type of file compression).  File compression is an important option because of the convenience it provides.  Note that the stock data we have here would be too large to be allowed to be hosted for free on GitHub if the file were not compressed.  Moreover, other cloud-based storage solutions like Amazon S3 will charge based on the amount of storage you request, so having the ability to use compressed files means you spend less money on storage costs.\n",

In a moment, you'll see what one looks like.  DataFrames are essentially a nested dictionary type of structure, but with a ton of convenience features added in to make them easy to work with.  For now, use the `.read_csv()` function and then tell Python that the returned value should be set to a variable named `data`."

For example, suppose a division manager at a firm wishes to determine whether a new investment project is worth purusing.  How should the manager make this decision?  One method to do this is with net present value (NPV).  Another is with internal rate of return (IRR).  You should have heard of both of these before, and will probably remember that NPV is the preferred approach.  As your first Python exercise, you'll get to prove to/remind yourself why one should *not* use IRR.\n",

To see what's going wrong here, recall tha the IRR is the discount rate that sets the cash flow stream to zero net present value.  In the `np.irr()` call above, Python returned an IRR to you.  But it's not the only possible IRR for this problem!  Mathematically, certain cash flow streams can have *multiple* IRRs that would set the cash flow stream to zero net present value.  To see this happen, plot the NPV for this cash flow stream over a range of possible discount rates (you'll find two that set the NPV to zero, one was the answer that `np.irr()` gave you above).
