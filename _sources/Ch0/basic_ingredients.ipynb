We work hard (say, for one semester of our lives) learning how to give a computer instructions (using Python) and then, for the rest of our lives, everything else is easier and more convenient because we can instruct a computer to do lots of the heavy lifting for us.  <u>In financial terms, we spend a little time now for a bunch of time saved later, and thus the net present value of learning to program is positive.</u>\n",
