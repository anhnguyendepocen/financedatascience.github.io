    "Lists are the easiest way to deal with data, but they're also the most limited.  For instance, what does `daily_stock_returns[2]` refer to?  We know that it has value $-0.02$, since that's the third element of the list.  But without any other reference point, the utility of this data is low.  We don't know, for instance, what date corresponds to list index value 2.  We also don't know which stock's returns are represented in this list.\n",

If we type `daily_stock_returns[0]`, we'd get the stock return for the first item in the list.  But what is `0`?  Besides a relative positioning, it doesn't tell us anything.

    "\n",
    "This is a bad practice for at least a couple of reasons.  First, one has to be extremely careful that the data line up properly so that `r_i[k]`, `r_m[k]`, and `r_f[k]` correspond to returns on the same date for every `k`.  Suppose that there is some missing data for some firm $j$ such that `r_j = [0.05, 0.02, 0.03, -0.04]`.  Without any additional information, it is impossible to track down which data point for firm $j$ is missing.  Second, it's difficult to reference returns at a particular date.  Suppose that you want to know the market return on `7/11/19`.  You would first have to determine that `t[k] = '7/11/19'` when `k = 3` and then go look up `r_m[3]` to get the market return.  Note that neither of these considerations imply that it is impossible to use lists to hold all the requisite data, it's just inconvenient for the programmer.  Remember, Python is supposed to make your life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose instead that we use a dictionary based approach to hold all of the data.  One way to do this is to construct a *nested dictionary*.  Nested dictionaries look like:\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "nested_dict = {'finance':\n",
    "                {'verb':'to supply with money or capital',\n",
    "                 'noun':'the management of revenues'},\n",
    "               'rate':\n",
    "                {'verb':'to estimate the value or worth of',\n",
    "                 'noun':'the amount of a charge or payment with reference to some basis of calculation'}\n",
    "              }\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here there is a dictionary with keys `'finance'` and `'rate'`.  The key `'finance'` has a value which is itself a dictionary: one key named `'verb'` which has value equal to the definition of \"finance\" used as a verb and another key named `'noun'` which has value equal to the definition of \"finance\" used as a noun.  Likewise the key `'rate'` has a value which is itself a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one enters `nested_dict['finance']`, Python will return the dictionary `{'verb':'to supply with money or capital', 'noun':'the management of revenues'}`.  Thus, to look up what the noun usage of \"finance\" is, one simply types `nested_dict['finance']['noun']`, which tells Python to look up the `noun` value to the dictionary value given by the key `'finance'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the conext of the current problem, a nested dictionary might look like:\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "daily_returns = {'r_i': {'7/8/19':0.03, '7/9/19':0.01, '7/10/19':-0.02, '7/11/19':0.01, '7/12/19':-0.01},\n",
    "                 'r_m': {'7/8/19':0.02, '7/9/19':0.01, '7/10/19':-0.03, '7/11/19':0.02, '7/12/19':-0.03},\n",

    "```\n",
    "The dictionary approach adds a convenience to the problem.  Now, if one wants to look up the market return on `7/11/19` one simply has to type `daily_returns['r_m']['7/11/19']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this approach still isn't perfect.  Remember, CAPM tells us that the excess return $r_{i,t}-r_{f,t}$ is defined by a linear function of the market risk premium $r_{m,t}-r_{f,t}$.  Therefore, what we want to do is to be able to tell Python to calculate the excess return and the market risk premium.  This is doable with a nested dictionary format, but it's a little complicated.  One would have to do something like the following (feel free to skip this code):\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "daily_returns['r_excess'] = {}\n",
    "daily_returns['r_riskpremium'] = {}\n",
    "for t in daily_returns['r_f'].values():\n",
    "    daily_returns['r_excess'].update(t:daily_returns['r_i'][t]-daily_returns['r_f'][t])\n",
    "    daily_returns['r_riskpremium'].update(t:daily_returns['r_m'][t]-daily_returns['r_f'][t])\n",
    "```\n",

Second, it can read compressed files (note that the file name used here ends with `.gz`, a type of file compression).  File compression is an important option because of the convenience it provides.  Note that the stock data we have here would be too large to be allowed to be hosted for free on GitHub if the file were not compressed.
